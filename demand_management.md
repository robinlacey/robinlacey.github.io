# Demand Management: Accelerating the Flow of Ideas to Production
​
Our clients have lots of great ideas they’re keen to get in front of their customers. We are often approached to help accelerate the delivery process so that customers can benefit from these ideas as quickly as possible.
​
Whilst there is a common misconception that this acceleration can be achieved through technological change alone, this is often not the case.
​
We must look at the organisation’s value stream - the path an idea takes from inception to live. The difficulty here is that this value stream is usually changed by the organisation over time, often moving away from its original intent and causing unintended friction deep within the organisation
​
Here are a few points of friction you may recognise:
​
- Projects get ‘stuck’ during software delivery, often being delivered late or over-budget
- Value proposition is being undercut by new industry players
- Increasing focus on SaaS products because delivering software in-house is complex
- Leaders often have to get involved with firefighting software delivery
- Often require consultants or contractors to bring in additional knowledge
​
These points of friction lead to a slower-moving software delivery process and a backlog of outstanding projects.
​
**So what can be done to understand and overcome these obstacles to speed up the delivery process?**
​
### Demand Management
​
Demand Management as a process is designed to cap demand and safeguard the limited delivery capability, letting only those projects of highest priority pass into delivery.
​
At Contino, we see the introduction of a Demand Management process as a stepping stone. The intent - like most imposed orchestration layers - is for it to dissolve as we help the organisation to improve the speed and quality of the software delivery process by better understanding the reason behind the points of friction. As an example, it might involve a move towards a decentralised product delivery approach, empowering the software teams that are closest to the customer to choose features that would best help those customers with their unmet needs.
​
### Our Approach to Accelerating the Delivery Process
​
Whilst every client is different, and every story is unique, here is an approach we take at Contino to understand and help an organisation suffering from costly and slow software delivery, using the principles of demand management to identify and overcome points of friction.
​
### 1\. Cap demand by implementing a short-term Demand Management process
​
First, we help the organisation make the most of the limited delivery capacity available. This involves applying additional scrutiny to how projects are prioritised and preempting potential issues before they arise during delivery and further erode delivery capacity.
​
Organisations often naturally build this short-term defense mechanism through centralised project prioritisation decisions. We augment this slightly by applying a balanced product management lens, prioritising those projects that are desirable, feasible and viable.

Good products and services are desirable, feasible and viable. Adapted from IDEO’s How to Prototype a New Business.
​
We determine this through interviews with project stakeholders and through workshops. If answers are uncertain, we partner with the project team to help surface the right information or to augment their project plans to surface these answers early. Reducing uncertainty in this way not only helps in prioritisation but it also aims to reduce the impact of issues that often arise late in project delivery; for example by clearly defining the project success metrics (as OKRs), or by identifying wider project dependencies.
​
### 2\. Identify obstacles that are slowing software delivery
​
Before we consider solutions to accelerate software delivery, we aim to understand the status quo and the reasons behind it. As pioneered in Lean Software Development, we help the client answer “how long does it take for a team to deploy into production a single small change that solves a customer problem?”.
​
We often use Value Stream Mapping as an approach to unearth and measure the common obstacles that lead to waste, such as delays or rework. Should the landscape be more complex, we may opt for the Theory of Constraints to help produce a more two-dimensional map of the organisation, and the reasons behind delivery woes.
​
### 3\. Test cure by running safe-to-fail experiments
​
We should have enough data at this point to form a hypothesis on the potential causes of friction. We accept that this data is not perfect and therefore requires validation before organisation-wide implementation and adoption.
​
To avoid prescribing change based on limited data, opinions or gut feelings we design safe, low-cost experiments that prove out a clear hypothesis, following three steps: measure, execute and learn.
